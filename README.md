# JSON-Fitness-Trackers
JSON Web Service Exercise

This is an exercise in producing a web service that retrieves the contents from a JSON file. A second JSON file is attached to the project that is alphabetically-sorted. This example offers a comparative look at some popular and available fitness trackers from a simple infrographic-style chart published in PC Magazine in December 2014. The JSON file is based on the data culled from the diagram details and renders the the ranking of fitness trackers according to PC Magazine Editor star rating with the highest star ranking beginning at the top of the JSON file.

## Usage

The HTML page relies upon AJAX and Jquery using the GET JSON method to loop through the JSON file array and clearly organizes the contents of the array according to product name, editor star rating, retail price and related meta details.

To view a demo of the web service, see project here: <a href="http://web-students.net/site9/jscript200/assignments/08/trackers-JSON.htm" target="_blank">http://web-students.net/site9/jscript200/assignments/08/trackers-JSON.htm</a>
